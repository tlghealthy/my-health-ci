Prompt to ask AI for help with living a healthy life:

Ask every month:
1. I want to live a healthy life and be proactive about taking care of my health. For a 30 year old male, what are some ideas for important things to consider over the next 70 years to increase potential healthspan?
2. For each of these, can you give me an idea of which time scale I should regularly reflect or take action? Once every 10 years? 5 years? 1 year? monthly? weekly?
3. Can you put these into several charts for me? like a general 4 week month chart, and an annual chart, and one for anything longer than annual? Let's leave out daily and weekly for now
4. I think these charts for monthly and longer time scales are more useful but the shorter ones feel like there is not enough time to fit everything in every day. Let's work on spreading these out into a general month-long chart of 4 weeks (28 days) where I can check off a few key things each day. For instance, during the first week of each month I already do a fitness test on myself which I can check off on the 7th day. Sleep and exercise are probably my top 2 most important activities right now so I want to do running and strength training twice per week each (at least) I think. We can have a separate general daily chart which includes things like stretching/yoga, not eating after 5:30pm etc. These are just a few things I am thinking about but I would really like to hear your recommendations
