My Health Continuous Improvement

## What is this?
A place where I track my journey from unhealthy to healthy living.

## How to track?
1. Starting with the most important things, I will upload the most important metrics here regularly.
0. Err on the side of updating too infrequently so as not to get overwhelmed because it is more important to keep tracking than to track a lot of data.

## What are the most important things?
1. Sleep - so far this is the main factor in feeling healthy each day
2. Exercise - vigorous exercise both gives me energy for my day but also helps me sleep better
3. Diet - not over-eating and eating a balanced diet of whole foods as much as possible also helps me sleep better

(more to be added after I feel proficient in the first 3)
