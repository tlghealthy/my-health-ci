### Welcome, I am the longevity gamer and this is:

# my-health-ci
My health continuous improvement project

## What is this?
A place where I track my journey of discovering the habits that give me the best health that I can measure.

## How to track?
1. Starting with the most important things, I will upload the most important metrics here regularly.
0. Err on the side of updating too infrequently so as not to get overwhelmed because it is more important to keep tracking than to track a lot of data.
0. I am also developing some of my own tracking tools such as list_editor.exe and testing them on myself (you are also welcome to try them).

## What are the most important things?
1. Sleep - so far this is the main factor for me to feel healthy each day
2. Exercise - vigorous exercise both gives me energy for my day but also helps me sleep better
3. Diet - not over-eating and eating a balanced diet of whole foods as much as possible also helps me sleep better and recover from hard exercise sooner (and it is delicious too)

(more to be added after I feel proficient in the first 3)
